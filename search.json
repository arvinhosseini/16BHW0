    "text": "Hello! In this blog post I will go over how to create a web scrapper using scrapy. For the purpose of this post, the goal of our web scrapper is to find all actors from a particular movie and output the list the actors along with all other movies or TV shows they have been in. The website we will be webscrapping is www.themoviedb.org, which is a website that holds movie and TV show information.\n\n\nThe first step is to include the neccesary packages. When I was creating this webscrapper, I had issues with 403 errors. Therefore, I used a proxy via ScrapeOps to help resolve the errors and successfully scrape the websites.\n\nimport scrapy\nfrom urllib.parse import urlencode\n\nAPI_KEY = \"816aed8f-f731-424c-b089-7c03af87389e\"\n\n\ndef get_scrapeops_url(url):\n    payload = {'api_key': API_KEY, 'url': url}\n    proxy_url = 'https://proxy.scrapeops.io/v1/?' + urlencode(payload)\n    return proxy_url\n\nThe get_scrapeops_url function will serve as a proxy and we can input a normal url into the function and it allow for us to not get flagged.\n\n\n\nNow that we have inlcuded everything neccessary, we can start building our Spider class from scrapy. First we need to declare the class and the definite the constructor function init which would define the starting url that we are trying to scrape.\n\nclass TmdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = 'tmdb_spider'\n\n    def __init__(self, subdir=None, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.start_urls = [get_scrapeops_url(f\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/{subdir}/\")]\n\nAs we can see, the we created the TmbdSpider class and named it ‘tmbd_spider’ and used the proxy to build our constructor. The {subdir} portion of the URL is what movie we are trying to scrape. For example, my favorie moive is Interstellar, so subdir will be defined as 157336-interstellar, since the full URL is https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/157336-interstellar.\nNext, we need to define our parse function, which will take our spider web scrapper to the cast and crew section of our movie.\n\ndef parse(self, response):\n   \"\"\"\n   Parses the response from the main page of a movie on www.themoviedb.org.\n\n   Assumptions:\n   - Assumes that the response is from the main page of a movie on www.themoviedb.org.\n\n   Effects:\n   - Navigates to the Full Cast & Crew page of the movie.\n   - Yields a scrapy.Request to parse the full credits page of the movie.\n\n   Args:\n      response: The response object containing the main page's HTML.\n\n   Yields:\n      scrapy.Request: A request to parse the full credits page of the movie.\n   \"\"\"\n   # Navigate to the Full Cast & Crew page\n   full_credits_url = response.url + '/cast/'\n   yield scrapy.Request(full_credits_url , callback=self.parse_full_credits)\n\nOn themoviedb webstite, once we are on our movie’s website (i.e. https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/157336-interstellar), if we click on the Full Cast and Crew button we are redirected to the cast page with the following URL: https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/157336-interstellar/cast. As we can see, the only difference between this URL and the previous is the added /cast at the end. Therefore, we will yeid the same URL as before and make sure to add the /cast/ the URL, so that we are now navigated to the Full Cast and Crew page.\n\n\n\nNext we will implement the parse_full_credits function of our spider class. The goal of this function will be to retrieve all the actor links for the actors in our movie. On the movie database website, each actor has their own page which lists information about thier bio, acting credits, and more. For example, the lead actor in Interstellar has the following page on TMDB: https://www.themoviedb.org/person/10297-matthew-mcconaughey. Here is the implementation of the parse_full_credits method:\n\ndef parse_full_credits(self, response):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parses the full credits page of a movie on www.themoviedb.org to retrieve actor links.\n\n        Assumptions:\n        - Assumes that the response is from the full credits page of a movie on www.themoviedb.org.\n\n        Effects:\n        - Extracts actor links from the page.\n        - Yields scrapy.Requests to parse each actor's page.\n\n        Args:\n            response: The response object containing the full credits page's HTML.\n\n        Yields:\n            scrapy.Request: Requests to parse each actor's page.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Extract actor links and yield requests for each actor's page\n        actor_links = response.css('div.info &gt; p &gt; a::attr(href)').getall()\n        for actor_link in actor_links:\n            yield scrapy.Request(get_scrapeops_url(\"https://www.themoviedb.org\" + actor_link), callback=self.parse_actor_page)\n\nIf we look at few of the pages on TMDB website, we notice that every acting page had the same starting URL: https://www.themoviedb.org. Therefore, we need to find what follows this URL, which we call actor_link, then add it to the starting URL, which will give the full URL for the acting page.\nBy going on the initial movie’s website and using the developer’s tools, I was able to find that link to every actor in the movie was listed in there. By following the path from div.info to p to a::attr(href), we are able to extract the second half the URL that we need.\nThus, we can yield the full URL for each actor in the movie.\n\n\n\nFinally, we need to implement our final function, the parse_actor_page function. The goal of this function to go through each of the actor’s page and extract all the movies and TV shows that they have appeared in. We will then yield the name of the actor and the list of movies and TV shows.\nLet’s first go over how to extract the name of the actor. The beggining of the parse_actor_page looks like this:\n\n\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parses an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org to retrieve their name and movie/TV show credits.\n\n        Assumptions:\n        - Assumes that the response is from an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org.\n\n        Effects:\n        - Extracts the actor's name and their movie/TV show credits.\n        - Yields the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n\n        Args:\n            response: The response object containing the actor's page's HTML.\n\n        Yields:\n            dict: A dictionary containing the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Extract actor name and movies/TV shows they have worked in\n        actor_name = response.css('head &gt; title::text').get()\n\n        # Extract only the part before the hyphen\n        actor_name = actor_name.split('—')[0].strip()\n\nUsing the developer’s tools again, I was able to see that every actor’s page had their name listed in the source code under, first under the head section, then under the title section. Therefore, the selector response.css(‘head &gt; title::text’).get(), would retrieve the title of the webpage. However, this response includes the title of the website. So for example, for Matthew McConaughey, the selector would give the following response: “Matthew McConaughey — The Movie Database (TMDB)”. Therefore we need to cut off everything from the long dash,‘—’, and onwards. By using the split function with ‘—’ and selecting the first half the split, [0], we are able to isolate the name of the actor. We will store this value in the variable actor_name.\nNext, we need to implement the second half the function that will extract the movie and TV names for every actor. Here is the full implementation of the parse_actor_page function, with the second half of the function:\n\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parses an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org to retrieve their name and movie/TV show credits.\n\n        Assumptions:\n        - Assumes that the response is from an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org.\n\n        Effects:\n        - Extracts the actor's name and their movie/TV show credits.\n        - Yields the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n\n        Args:\n            response: The response object containing the actor's page's HTML.\n\n        Yields:\n            dict: A dictionary containing the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Extract actor name and movies/TV shows they have worked in\n        actor_name = response.css('head &gt; title::text').get()\n\n        # Extract only the part before the hyphen\n        actor_name = actor_name.split('—')[0].strip()\n\n       # Find the index of 'Acting' in the list of credits\n        acting_index = response.xpath('//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/h3/text()').getall().index('Acting')\n\n        # Select the element corresponding to 'Acting' and its associated table\n        acting_only = response.xpath(f'(//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/table[@class=\"card credits\"])[{acting_index + 1}]')\n\n        # Extract movie or TV names from the selected table\n        movie_or_TV_name = acting_only.xpath('.//a[@class=\"tooltip\"]/bdi/text()').getall()\n\n\n        for movie_or_TV_name in movie_or_TV_name:\n            yield {\n                \"actor\":actor_name,\n                \"movie_or_TV_name\": movie_or_TV_name\n            }\n\nThis part was a bit tricky as we want to make sure that we only select movies and TV shows in which the person’s page that we are personing were credited in an acting role, as some also have production and other credits that we do not want included in the list.\nIn order to do this we must take advantage of the indexing in source code that will allow us to select only the acting roles. After looking an the source code on the page, we can see that all the acting roles for an actor had a line in common before listing all acting roles:\n&lt;h3 class=“zero”&gt;Acting&lt;&gt;\n\nTherefore we can use the follwoing xpath response to find the index for each actor:\n\nresponse.xpath('//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/h3/text()').getall().index('Acting')\n\nWe will store this index under the variable name actor_index.\nNext we must use this variable to find the table on the actors page that corresponds to the acting index. Thus we can use the following to return this section of the table under the acting index.\n\nresponse.xpath(f'(//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/table[@class=\"card credits\"])[{acting_index + 1}]')\n\nThe reason we must add the +1 to acting_index is that xpath starts its index at 1 instead of 0. Therefore we must account for this change by adding the one.\nThe final stage of our extraction is to go through the table we selected and retrieve the title of each movie or TV show that the actor appears in.\nUsing the inspect element tool again, we can see that information is located under the &lt;a class = “tooltip”&gt; section, with the text of the film being wrapped by the &lt;bdi&gt; markers.\nTherefore, we can use the followig line to get all the titles of the films and shows, as we are already under the acting table of the page. Therefore movie_or_TV_name will be a list of the credits for each actor.\n\nacting_only.xpath('.//a[@class=\"tooltip\"]/bdi/text()').getall()\n\nFinally, we yield the actors name and the credited film or TV show under the names “actor” and “movie_or_TV_show”, so when we export to a CSV file they will be the name of our columns.\nNow that we have completed our spider class, we can run our code and output to a CSV file called output. Therefore we must run the following line in our terminal.\nscrapy crawl tmdb_spider -o output.csv -a subdir=157336-interstellar\nThis will create an output called output.csv, we can read this file into a Pandas dataframe to view our data.\n\n\n\nNow that we have our output we can convert the csv file into a Pandas dataframe to view and analyze our data. In a seperate file we can import Pandas and run the following line of code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"output.csv\")\n\ndf.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 2063 entries, 0 to 2062\nData columns (total 2 columns):\n #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype \n---  ------            --------------  ----- \n 0   actor             2063 non-null   object\n 1   movie_or_TV_name  2063 non-null   object\ndtypes: object(2)\nmemory usage: 32.4+ KB\n\n\nAs we can see we have 2063 rows of movie and TV show titles, with the columns actor and movie_or_TV_name.\nHere is a what our data table would look like:\n\ndf.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactor\nmovie_or_TV_name\n\n\n\n\n0\nMatthew McConaughey\n2024\n\n\n1\nMatthew McConaughey\nThe Lost Bus\n\n\n2\nMatthew McConaughey\nThe Rivals of Amziah King\n\n\n3\nMatthew McConaughey\nAgent Elvis\n\n\n4\nMatthew McConaughey\nThe Jennifer Hudson Show\n\n\n5\nMatthew McConaughey\nDeep in the Heart: A Texas Wildlife Story\n\n\n6\nMatthew McConaughey\nSing 2\n\n\n7\nMatthew McConaughey\nCome Home\n\n\n8\nMatthew McConaughey\n05\n\n\n9\nMatthew McConaughey\nRoll Up Your Sleeves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that Matthew McConaughey is the first actor in our list and we can see his associated roles, for example “The Lost Bus” and “Come Home” are a couple of his roles.\nNext we can see compute a sorted list with the top movies and TV shows that share actors from the movie Interstellar.\nFirst we need to count the data by the tile of the role:\n\ncounted = df[\"movie_or_TV_name\"].value_counts()\ncounted\n\nmovie_or_TV_name\nInterstellar                   35\nSaturday Night Live            10\nThe View                        9\nLate Night with Seth Meyers     9\nInside 'Interstellar'           8\n                               ..\nMayo                            1\nAs You Like It                  1\nBorn Equal                      1\nFive Days                       1\nThree Below Zero                1\nName: count, Length: 1754, dtype: int64\n\n\nAs we can see the movie that we based our web crawler on appears first, so we should drop that from the list.\n\ncounted = counted.drop(counted.index[0])\n\nNext, in order to for us to work with this data easier we must convert the Pandas series into a Pandas Data Frame and reset the index.\n\ncounted = counted.to_frame()\ncounted.reset_index(inplace=True)\n\nWe will also renmae the columns to Movie or Show Title and Number of Shared Actors.\n\ncounted = counted.rename(columns={\"movie_or_TV_name\":\"Movie or Show Title\", \"count\":\"Number of Shared Actors\"})\n\nThus our new dataframe looks like the following:\n\ncounted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovie or Show Title\nNumber of Shared Actors\n\n\n\n\n0\nSaturday Night Live\n10\n\n\n1\nThe View\n9\n\n\n2\nLate Night with Seth Meyers\n9\n\n\n3\nInside 'Interstellar'\n8\n\n\n4\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\n8\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1748\nMayo\n1\n\n\n1749\nAs You Like It\n1\n\n\n1750\nBorn Equal\n1\n\n\n1751\nFive Days\n1\n\n\n1752\nThree Below Zero\n1\n\n\n\n\n1753 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nNow we can use plotly to create a bar graph of the some of the most common shared movies or TV shows among the actors in Interstellar. Since there are 1753 movies or TV shows, we will only pick the top 15 titles to display.\n\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.io as pio\n\npio.renderers.default = 'iframe'\n\n\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ntop_counted = counted.head(15)\n\n# Create a bar chart using Plotly\nfig = px.bar(top_counted, x='Movie or Show Title', y='Number of Shared Actors', title='Number of Shared Actors per Movie or Show')\n\n# Show the plot\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the top shared movies and shows are displayed in an interactive bar graph format, where if we hover over the bar we can exactly how many shared actors there are. The results are somewhat expected as well. We can see a majority of the shared titles are from late night shows or talk shows. This makes sense, as actors and celebrities often appear on these shows. Since Interstellar has a good amount of famous actors that would appear on these shows, the top results are something that we expect.\nOther top shared roles are Inside “Interstellar”, which is a documentary on how the film was made, so it would make sense that a lot of the actors from Interstellar would appear in the documentary.\nAnother film of note is The Dark Knight Rises. This film, along with Interstellar, was directed by Christopher Nolan, and he is know for using some of the same actors in his films. Therefore it is not suprising to see one of his films on this list.\n\n\n\nFor our second data analysis, we can find the number of roles that each actor has been in and then display a bar graph to visualize the data.\nWe will count the number of roles and then sort by highest of number of roles. We will use plotly again to produce the graph.\n\n# Count number of roles and sort by highest number\nroles_count = df.groupby('actor').size().reset_index(name='Number of Roles')\n\nroles_count = roles_count.sort_values(by='Number of Roles', ascending=False)\n\n# Create a bar chart using Plotly\nfig = px.bar(roles_count, x='actor', y='Number of Roles', title='Number of Roles for Each Actor')\n\n# Show the plot\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the interactive bar graph is displayed. The results are also what we expected. The actor with (by far) the highest number of roles is Michael Caine, with 224 roles. This is not suprising as Michael Caine is one of the oldest actors and has had a very long career in the film industry.\nWe can also see Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, and Anne Hathaway have the fourth, fifth, and sixth top roles. These are famous contemporary actors who have appeared in many famous films as well as have had very successfull careers. Therefore it is not suprising to see them near the top of the list.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading my blog post! I hope that you were able to learn more about web scrapping as well as how to display scrapped data."

The beggining of the parse_actor_page looks like this:\n\n\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parses an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org to retrieve their name and movie/TV show credits.\n\n        Assumptions:\n        - Assumes that the response is from an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org.\n\n        Effects:\n        - Extracts the actor's name and their movie/TV show credits.\n        - Yields the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n\n        Args:\n            response: The response object containing the actor's page's HTML.\n\n        Yields:\n            dict: A dictionary containing the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Extract actor name and movies/TV shows they have worked in\n        actor_name = response.css('head &gt; title::text').get()\n\n        # Extract only the part before the hyphen\n        actor_name = actor_name.split('—')[0].strip()\n\nUsing the developer’s tools again, I was able to see that every actor’s page had their name listed in the source code under, first under the head section, then under the title section. Therefore, the selector response.css(‘head &gt; title::text’).get(), would retrieve the title of the webpage. However, this response includes the title of the website. So for example, for Matthew McConaughey, the selector would give the following response: “Matthew McConaughey — The Movie Database (TMDB)”. Therefore we need to cut off everything from the long dash,‘—’, and onwards. By using the split function with ‘—’ and selecting the first half the split, [0], we are able to isolate the name of the actor. We will store this value in the variable actor_name.\nNext, we need to implement the second half the function that will extract the movie and TV names for every actor. Here is the full implementation of the parse_actor_page function, with the second half of the function:\n\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parses an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org to retrieve their name and movie/TV show credits.\n\n        Assumptions:\n        - Assumes that the response is from an actor's page on www.themoviedb.org.\n\n        Effects:\n        - Extracts the actor's name and their movie/TV show credits.\n        - Yields the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n\n        Args:\n            response: The response object containing the actor's page's HTML.\n\n        Yields:\n            dict: A dictionary containing the actor's name and their credited movie/TV show.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Extract actor name and movies/TV shows they have worked in\n        actor_name = response.css('head &gt; title::text').get()\n\n        # Extract only the part before the hyphen\n        actor_name = actor_name.split('—')[0].strip()\n\n       # Find the index of 'Acting' in the list of credits\n        acting_index = response.xpath('//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/h3/text()').getall().index('Acting')\n\n        # Select the element corresponding to 'Acting' and its associated table\n        acting_only = response.xpath(f'(//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/table[@class=\"card credits\"])[{acting_index + 1}]')\n\n        # Extract movie or TV names from the selected table\n        movie_or_TV_name = acting_only.xpath('.//a[@class=\"tooltip\"]/bdi/text()').getall()\n\n\n        for movie_or_TV_name in movie_or_TV_name:\n            yield {\n                \"actor\":actor_name,\n                \"movie_or_TV_name\": movie_or_TV_name\n            }\n\nThis part was a bit tricky as we want to make sure that we only select movies and TV shows in which the person’s page that we are personing were credited in an acting role, as some also have production and other credits that we do not want included in the list.\nIn order to do this we must take advantage of the indexing in source code that will allow us to select only the acting roles. After looking an the source code on the page, we can see that all the acting roles for an actor had a line in common before listing all acting roles:\n&lt;h3 class=“zero”&gt;Acting&lt;&gt;\n\nTherefore we can use the follwoing xpath response to find the index for each actor:\n\nresponse.xpath('//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/h3/text()').getall().index('Acting')\n\nWe will store this index under the variable name actor_index.\nNext we must use this variable to find the table on the actors page that corresponds to the acting index. Thus we can use the following to return this section of the table under the acting index.\n\nresponse.xpath(f'(//div[@class=\"credits_list\"]/table[@class=\"card credits\"])[{acting_index + 1}]')\n\nThe reason we must add the +1 to acting_index is that xpath starts its index at 1 instead of 0. Therefore we must account for this change by adding the one.\nThe final stage of our extraction is to go through the table we selected and retrieve the title of each movie or TV show that the actor appears in.\nUsing the inspect element tool again, we can see that information is located under the &lt;a class = “tooltip”&gt; section, with the text of the film being wrapped by the &lt;bdi&gt; markers.\nTherefore, we can use the followig line to get all the titles of the films and shows, as we are already under the acting table of the page. Therefore movie_or_TV_name will be a list of the credits for each actor.\n\nacting_only.xpath('.//a[@class=\"tooltip\"]/bdi/text()').getall()\n\nFinally, we yield the actors name and the credited film or TV show under the names “actor” and “movie_or_TV_show”, so when we export to a CSV file they will be the name of our columns.\nNow that we have completed our spider class, we can run our code and output to a CSV file called output. Therefore we must run the following line in our terminal.\nscrapy crawl tmdb_spider -o output.csv -a subdir=157336-interstellar\nThis will create an output called output.csv, we can read this file into a Pandas dataframe to view our data."

Since there are 1753 movies or TV shows, we will only pick the top 15 titles to display.\n\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.io as pio\n\npio.renderers.default = 'iframe'\n\n\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ntop_counted = counted.head(15)\n\n# Create a bar chart using Plotly\nfig = px.bar(top_counted, x='Movie or Show Title', y='Number of Shared Actors', title='Number of Shared Actors per Movie or Show')\n\n# Show the plot\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the top shared movies and shows are displayed in an interactive bar graph format, where if we hover over the bar we can exactly how many shared actors there are. The results are somewhat expected as well. We can see a majority of the shared titles are from late night shows or talk shows. This makes sense, as actors and celebrities often appear on these shows. Since Interstellar has a good amount of famous actors that would appear on these shows, the top results are something that we expect.\nOther top shared roles are Inside “Interstellar”, which is a documentary on how the film was made, so it would make sense that a lot of the actors from Interstellar would appear in the documentary.\nAnother film of note is The Dark Knight Rises. This film, along with Interstellar, was directed by Christopher Nolan, and he is know for using some of the same actors in his films. Therefore it is not suprising to see one of his films on this list."

The results are also what we expected. The actor with (by far) the highest number of roles is Michael Caine, with 224 roles. This is not suprising as Michael Caine is one of the oldest actors and has had a very long career in the film industry.\nWe can also see Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, and Anne Hathaway have the fourth, fifth, and sixth top roles. These are famous contemporary actors who have appeared in many famous films as well as have had very successfull careers. Therefore it is not suprising to see them near the top of the list."

When the users want to post a message, they should be prompted with two fields: one for their name and one for their message.\nNext, we want a user to be able to view messages of the message board as well. When the user wants to view messages they should see a defined number of random messages from the message board.\nFinally, we want to add some style to our website using CSS so the website is not boring and can be more engaging.\n\n\n\nFirst we need to include our neccesary packages into our main file, called app.py.\nWill also create our app, named app, that uses flask.\n\nimport sqlite3\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom flask import Flask, g, render_template, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n\n\n\nNext, using sqlite, we will create and host a database. This database will contain all the messages that different users submit to our message board. This database will also be used later on to display some of the messages when the user choses to view messages.\nHere is how the function, get_message_db(), is defined:\n\ndef get_message_db():\n    try:\n        return g.message_db\n    except AttributeError:\n        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect(\"messages_db.sqlite\")\n        cursor = g.message_db.cursor()\n        \n        # Create the messages table if it doesn't exist\n        cmd = 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (name TEXT, message TEXT);'\n        cursor.execute(cmd)\n        g.message_db.commit()\n        \n        return g.message_db\n\nWe can see that at first we try to access the database. If it not is created then we get an attribuite error so we will connect to sqlite and create our database.\nWe then create a cursor using the .cursor() function that will allow us to use SQL code to create our database.\nWe then use CREATE TABLE to make our table called messaages. This table has two columns, name and message, as these are the only things that user is able to submit to the website.\nFinally, we execute and commit the SQL code and then return the database.\n\n\n\nWe wil next go over how to insert user messages into the database that we just created. We will do this by using the insert_messages() function. This function takes in one variable, request. From request we can access the name and the message that we want to insert into the database. We will be going how we got the request later on when we go over our routes.\nHere is the defintion for our insert_messages() function:\n\ndef insert_message(request):\n    # Get the message and the name\n    message = request.form['message']\n    name = request.form[\"name\"]\n    db = get_message_db()\n    cursor = db.cursor()\n    print(\"here\")\n    # Insert the data into our database\n    cursor.execute('INSERT INTO messages (name, message) VALUES (?, ?)', (name, message))\n    db.commit()\n    cursor.close()\n    db.close()\n    return message, name\n\nIn the function we first extract the message and name from the request and store them under the same variable names.\nNext, use our previous function to get the database and store as the variable db.\nThen we use the cursur to write an SQL command to insert the message and name as a tuple into our database.\nMake sure to close the cursor and databse, and then we return the tuple as well.\n\n\n\nOur last main function we need to implement is the random messages function. The goal of this function is to retrieve an n amount of random messages from our database. We will later use this function to display these messages on the website.\nThe function is defined as the following:\n\ndef random_messages(n):\n    # Connect to database\n    db = get_message_db()\n    cursor = db.cursor()\n\n    # Find n random messages\n    cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT ?\", (n,))\n    random_messages = cursor.fetchall()\n\n    # Close database\n    cursor.close()\n    db.close()\n\n    return random_messages\n\nWe can see we use the same idea as before, connecting to the database with the cursor. The main part of this function is using the ORDER BY and RANDOM() SQL commands to grab the first n tuples in the database. Since we are using RANDOM() then these n tuples will be different every time and ensures randomness.\nFinally, we close the database and return the random messages.\n\n\n\nNow that we have finished writing our main three functions, we can write our routes for the website. This is the backend implementation of what is happening when the user goes onto the post message or view message page, as well as when the user decides to post a message.\n\n\n\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    return render_template('base.html')\n\nWe can see that our first route is very simple. This is for when we first get onto the website, so the route is just a slash which leads to a base page. When we get onto this page we render the base.html file, which contains two options for the user: post message or view message.\nWe will go over the set up of base.html and the other templates after we finish going over the routes.\n\n\n\nNext, we will write the route for the submit page, which will be /submit/. This route should allow the user to post a message onto the message board. This message should then be entered into the database.\nHere is the implementaion of the submit route:\n\n# Route to render the submit page\n@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST', 'GET'])\ndef submit():\n    if request.method == 'GET':\n        return render_template('submit.html')\n    else:\n        insert_message(request)\n        return render_template('submit.html')\n\nWe can see that within the route that we have two methods: POST and GET.\nIf the method is GET then we simply render the submit.html page. However if the method is POST, then the user wants to post a message onto the board. Therefore we use the insert_message function from earlier to insert the data into the databse. We still render the submit.html page in this method as well.\n\n\n\nOur final route is the view route. This is for when the user wants view some of the random messages in the databse. We will access this route using /view.\nHere is the implementation of the view route:\n\n@app.route('/view')\ndef view():\n    try:\n        messages = random_messages(5)\n        return render_template('view.html', messages=messages)\n    except:\n        return render_template\n\nWe can see that we use the random_messages function with n = 5 and store the messages in the messages variable. For now we are just using n = 5 but we can always change this later. We then render the view.html page along with the messages.\n\n\n\nNow that we have gone over functions and routes of our website, we will go over our main three templates.\n\n\n\nOur first template is names base.html. This serves as the landing page for our website, so when we enter the address the site this is where we are taken. The base.html site will greet the user and ask them to either post a message onto the board or view some random messages.\nWe will also use the base.html to build our other two templates: submit and view.\nHere is the set up of base.html:\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;{% block title %}{% endblock %} Message Bank&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;nav&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the Message Bank!&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Hi! Welcome to my message bank. Please feel free to post a new message by clicking on the &lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('submit') }}\"&gt;Post Messages&lt;/a&gt; link. You can also view some random messages from the bank by clicking &lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('view') }}\"&gt;View Messages&lt;/a&gt;. Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('submit') }}\"&gt;Post Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('view') }}\"&gt;View Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;    \n\n&lt;section class=\"content\"&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    {% block header %}{% endblock %}\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nWe can see that the some of this file is styling the page. This was actually really fun as I got to mess around with different styles and colors.\nHowever the most important part of this file is the following section:\n\n&lt;nav&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the Message Bank!&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Hi! Welcome to my message bank. Please feel free to post a new message by clicking on the &lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('submit') }}\"&gt;Post Messages&lt;/a&gt; link. You can also view some random messages from the bank by clicking &lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('view') }}\"&gt;View Messages&lt;/a&gt;. Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('submit') }}\"&gt;Post Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('view') }}\"&gt;View Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt; \n\nThis section greats the user by welcoming them to the message bank and telling the user the options they can do from here.\nWe also create two links for the user “Post Messages” and “View Messages” that would lead to the submit and view routes respectively.\nTherefore once a user chooses what they want to do they are redirected to the correct page.\nWe can also view the style.css file that I used for styling the base page:\n\nbody {\n    background-color: #192841; /* Dark blue background */\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n}\nnav {\n    border-bottom: 2px solid gold;\n    padding-bottom: 20px;\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n}\nh1 {\n    color: white;\n    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n    font-size: 28px;\n}\np {\n    color: orange;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\np a {\n    color: gold;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    transition: color 0.3s ease;\n}\np a:hover {\n    color: lightgoldenrodyellow;\n}\nul {\n    list-style-type: none;\n    padding: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n}\nul li {\n    display: inline-block;\n    margin-right: 20px;\n}\nul li a {\n    color: gold;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;\n    transition: border-bottom-color 0.3s ease;\n}\nul li a:hover {\n    border-bottom-color: gold;\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have a template for the submit page called submit.html. Here the user is able to submit a message to the message bank.\nHere is the template for submit.html:\n\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block header %}\n  &lt;h1 style=\"color: green; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)\"&gt;{% block title %}&lt;span class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;Submit a Message&lt;/span&gt;{% endblock %}&lt;/h1&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n{% block content %}\n\n  &lt;style&gt;\n    /* Import Google Fonts */\n    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Protest+Guerrilla&display=swap');\n\n    /* Apply custom font */\n    .protest-guerrilla-regular {\n      font-family: \"Protest Guerrilla\", sans-serif;\n      font-weight: 400;\n      font-style: normal;\n    }\n\n    /* Set background color */\n    body {\n      background-color:  #192841;\n    }\n  &lt;/style&gt;\n\n  &lt;form method=\"post\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"name\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;What's your name?&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input name=\"name\" id=\"name\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;What is your message?&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" id=\"message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n      &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Post Message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n  {% if sec == True %}\n  &lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;b&gt;Message sent&lt;/b&gt;\n  {% endif %}\n{% endblock %}\n\nAgain, some of this file is the style prefernces for the page. I choose to use a google api to get the Protest Guerrilla font for some of this page.\nWe can examine the most important part of the file below:\n\n&lt;form method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;label for=\"name\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;What's your name?&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"name\" id=\"name\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n    &lt;label for=\"message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;What is your message?&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" id=\"message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Post Message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nWe can see that there are two prompts for the user: “What’s your name?” and “What is your message?”. We can see that these are then called name and message respectively. So once the user submits their info the input_message function will be called and their info will be entered into the database.\nThe html page is also based on base.html as we include {% extends ‘base.html’ %} at the top of the page. Therefore the writing of the home page is still there and the prompts show up below.\n\n\n\nFinally, we have our third template, view.html. This page will allow the user to view the random messages from the message bank.\nHere is the implementation of the view.html template:\n\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block title %}\n    Random Messages\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n    &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;Random Messages&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n            {% for message in messages %}\n                &lt;li&gt;\n                    &lt;div class=\"message\"&gt;\n                        &lt;p&gt;{{ message[0] }}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- name --&gt;\n                        &lt;p&gt;{{ message[1] }}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- message --&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            {% endfor %}\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block header %}\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='view_style.css') }}\"&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\nAs before, we still use base.html to extend this template and some the code is for styling. As I wanted this page to have its own style for the viewing of the message bank, I created a new file called view_style.css for the style of this page. We can take a look into the most imporant parts of the template.\n\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Random Messages&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        {% for message in messages %}\n            &lt;li&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"message\"&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{{ message[0] }}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- name --&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{{ message[1] }}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- message --&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n        {% endfor %}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nWe can see that we call the top of the page Random Messages. We then run a loop to go over all the individual messages in messages that we retrieved from our random_messages function. Then for each message we output the name and message, with indices of 0 and 1 respectively.\nWe can also look at the view_style.css page that was used for styling below:\n\n        \n        /* Additional styles specific to this template */\n        .container {\n            max-width: 800px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n            background-color: #333; /* Darker gray container background */\n            border-radius: 10px; /* Rounded corners */\n            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Shadow effect */\n        }\n        h1 {\n            text-align: center;\n            color: #ff5722; /* Orange color */\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n            font-size: 36px; /* Larger font size */\n        }\n        ul {\n            list-style-type: none;\n            padding: 0;\n            margin: 0;\n        }\n        .message {\n            background-color: #444; /* Dark gray message background */\n            border-radius: 10px; /* Rounded corners */\n            box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Shadow effect */\n            padding: 20px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */\n        }\n        .message:hover {\n            box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Larger shadow on hover */\n            transform: translateY(-5px); /* Move up slightly on hover */\n        }\n        p {\n            color: #ccc; /* Light gray text */\n            font-size: 18px; /* Medium font size */\n            font-style: italic; /* Italic text */\n            margin: 0; /* Remove default margin */\n        }\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have gone through the implementation on the webstie we can run through a quick demo of the site.\nWe will first look at the base page of the website:\n\n\n\nHome Page of Message Bank\n\n\nAs we can “Welcome to the Message Bank!” is displayed at the top the site, followed by the description of what the site does.\nBelow the discription, we can see two different links to click: Post Messages and View Messages. These will allow the user to move to different parts of the site.\nWe can also see that there are no routes in the url so we are at the base page and the webpage is called Message Bank, as we can see on the tab.\nAs an example lets navigate to the Post Messages page and fill in an example posted message:\n\n\n\nSubmit Page of Message Bank\n\n\nAs we can see we have naviagted to the submit page of the website. We see that the /submit route is added to the URL. The user is now able to input their name and their message. We can also see some of the style changes, as the google api font is used in this section.\nIn this example, the name is Arvin (my name) and the message is that I love basketball.\nWe can then click the submit button and it would send this tuple to the database.\nFinally we can look at the view page of the website. Let’s navigate to that:\n\n\n\nView Page of Message Bank\n\n\nAs we can see we are now in the view page of the website. We see that the route has now changed from /submit to /view. We can also see that there is a box with five random messages from the databse. All the messages have the names and the personal message attached. We see that the message that we submitted in the last page appears here as well.\n\n\n\nThe files for this website are hosted on a github repository. The repository is public so people are able to pull the code and make some modifications if they were interested.\nHere is the link to the repository for the project:\nhttps://github.com/arvinhosseini/messagebank\n\n\n\nThank you for reading my post! I hope that you were able to learn a bit about web development with flask, using a database, and CSS styling!"

The main part of this function is using the ORDER BY and RANDOM() SQL commands to grab the first n tuples in the database. Since we are using RANDOM() then these n tuples will be different every time and ensures randomness.\nFinally, we close the database and return the random messages."

Welcome to my message bank. Please feel free to post a new message by clicking on the &lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('submit') }}\"&gt;Post Messages&lt;/a&gt; link.

I choose to use a google api to get the Protest Guerrilla font for some of this page.\nWe can examine the most important part of the file below:\n\n&lt;form method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;label for=\"name\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;What's your name?&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"name\" id=\"name\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n    &lt;label for=\"message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;What is your message?&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" id=\"message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Post Message\" class=\"protest-guerrilla-regular\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nWe can see that there are two prompts for the user: “What’s your name?” and “What is your message?”. We can see that these are then called name and message respectively. So once the user submits their info the input_message function will be called and their info will be entered into the database.\nThe html page is also based on base.html as we include {% extends ‘base.html’ %} at the top of the page. Therefore the writing of the home page is still there and the prompts show up below."

As I wanted this page to have its own style for the viewing of the message bank, I created a new file called view_style.css for the style of this page. We can take a look into the most imporant parts of the template.\n\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Random Messages&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        {% for message in messages %}\n            &lt;li&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"message\"&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{{ message[0] }}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- name --&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{{ message[1] }}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- message --&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n        {% endfor %}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nWe can see that we call the top of the page Random Messages. We then run a loop to go over all the individual messages in messages that we retrieved from our random_messages function. Then for each message we output the name and message, with indices of 0 and 1 respectively.\nWe can also look at the view_style.css page that was used for styling below:\n\n        \n        /* Additional styles specific to this template */\n        .container {\n            max-width: 800px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n            background-color: #333; /* Darker gray container background */\n            border-radius: 10px; /* Rounded corners */\n            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Shadow effect */\n        }\n        h1 {\n            text-align: center;\n            color: #ff5722; /* Orange color */\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n            font-size: 36px; /* Larger font size */\n        }\n        ul {\n            list-style-type: none;\n            padding: 0;\n            margin: 0;\n        }\n        .message {\n            background-color: #444; /* Dark gray message background */\n            border-radius: 10px; /* Rounded corners */\n            box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Shadow effect */\n            padding: 20px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */\n        }\n        .message:hover {\n            box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Larger shadow on hover */\n            transform: translateY(-5px); /* Move up slightly on hover */\n        }\n        p {\n            color: #ccc; /* Light gray text */\n            font-size: 18px; /* Medium font size */\n            font-style: italic; /* Italic text */\n            margin: 0; /* Remove default margin */\n        }"

    "text": "Hello! Welcome to this blog post where I will go over how to use databases for data visualization. For this post we will be using example data of temperature data from various different countries.\n\n\nFirst we need to run the following line of code:\n\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.io as pio\n\npio.renderers.default = 'iframe'\n\n\nFor this post, we are going to be using SQL queries in order to retrevie our data. Then we are going to use some data visualization software to answer a few questions. We will be using sqlite to establish a database and to retreive our data.\n\n\n\nIn a seperate file, I already loaded in the data into a database named “database.db”. Thus we will connect to this database in order to get information about our data. The data we are using consists of three different tables: stations, countries, and temperatures. This data has been collected and shows the temperature readings of different stations in various countries over the years.\nWe will use this data to answer our first question: How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?\nThus we need to use an SQL query to acess the data that is useful for answering this question.\nWe will also need to include the headers necessary for the rest of the post.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport sqlite3\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nHere is the query we will use. The function allows a user a to input a database file, country, year_begin, year_end, and month to find the data needed to answer our question.\n\ndef query_climate_database(db_file, country, year_begin, year_end, month):\n    with sqlite3.connect(db_file) as conn:\n        cmd = f\"\"\"\n            SELECT\n                stations.NAME,\n                stations.LATITUDE,\n                stations.LONGITUDE,\n                countries.Name AS Country,\n                temperatures.Year,\n                temperatures.Month,\n                temperatures.Temp\n            FROM\n                temperatures\n            JOIN\n                stations ON temperatures.ID = stations.ID\n            JOIN\n                countries ON SUBSTR(stations.ID, 1, 2) = SUBSTR(countries.\"FIPS 10-4\", 1, 2)\n            WHERE\n                countries.Name = '{country}'\n                AND temperatures.Year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end}\n                AND temperatures.Month = {month}\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Execute the query and read the results into a DataFrame\n        result_df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)\n    conn.close()\n    return result_df\n\nNow in our dataframe we have the data that we will use the answer our question: the station’s name, latitude, and longitude, the country’s name, and the tempature of the country and the month we are looking at. This data is stored in result_df.\nThus, we can now write a fucntion, temperature_coefficient_plot to use the pulled data and make a plot. The goal of this function is to create a plot of the selected country with a scatter of data points located at the stations used. Each datapoint will store information about the average yearly change in temperature for the associated station.\nThe function uses the same variables as the previous function, in addition to mins_obs, zoom, mapbox_style, and color_continuous_scale. mins_obs is an inputed variable that only shows stations that have at least mins_obs years of observatoin.

It also filters out any statoins with less than mins_obs years of data. It will store these dataframes in a dictionary where the key will be the name of the station.\nNow that we have the dictionary of station’s data, we use linear regression from the scikit.learn libray, to fit a line of best fit for each station. Thus, the slope of this line will be the rate of change for the temperature at the given station. We will put each station and its rate of change in a seperate dataframe along with the station longitude and latitude. This information will be stored in a dataframe called results.\nSo the list of the rates of change will look like the following.\n\n# create dictionary for dataframes, each keyed by the unique \"NAME\"\ndfs_dict = {name: group for name, group in grouped_df}\n\nfiltered_dfs_dict = {name: group_df for name, group_df in dfs_dict.items() if len(group_df) &gt;= min_obs}\n\n#calculate expected change in temp for each station\ndef coef(data_group):\n    x = data_group[[\"Year\"]]\n    y = data_group[\"Temp\"]\n    LR = LinearRegression()\n    LR.fit(x, y)\n    return LR.coef_[0]\n\nresults = pd.DataFrame()\n\nfor name, filtered_df in filtered_dfs_dict.items():\n        temp_change = filtered_df.groupby(\"NAME\").apply(coef).reset_index(name='temp_change')\n    \n        latitude = filtered_df[\"LATITUDE\"].iloc[0]\n        longitude = filtered_df[\"LONGITUDE\"].iloc[0]\n\n        result_row = pd.DataFrame({\n            \"NAME\": [name],\n            \"LATITUDE\": [latitude],\n            \"LONGITUDE\": [longitude],\n            \"EXPECTED_CHANGE\": [temp_change[\"temp_change\"].iloc[0]]\n        })\n\n        results = results._append(result_row, ignore_index=True)\n\nresults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME\nLATITUDE\nLONGITUDE\nEXPECTED_CHANGE\n\n\n\n\n0\nAGARTALA\n23.883\n91.250\n-0.006184\n\n\n1\nAHMADABAD\n23.067\n72.633\n0.006731\n\n\n2\nAKOLA\n20.700\n77.033\n-0.008063\n\n\n3\nALLAHABAD\n25.441\n81.735\n-0.029375\n\n\n4\nALLAHABAD_BAMHRAULI\n25.500\n81.900\n-0.015457\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n92\nTRIVANDRUM\n8.500\n77.000\n0.022892\n\n\n93\nUDAIPUR_DABOK\n24.617\n73.883\n0.072424\n\n\n94\nVARANASI_BABATPUR\n25.450\n82.867\n-0.012996\n\n\n95\nVERAVAL\n20.900\n70.367\n0.024848\n\n\n96\nVISHAKHAPATNAM\n17.717\n83.233\n-0.034050\n\n\n\n\n97 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\nFinally, using plotly, we will graph this data on the plot of the chosen country. The function temperature_coefficient_plot has the variables, zoom, mapbox_style, and color_continuous_scale, predefined. Thus a user can choose to input their own prefrences for these variables but if not it will be set to the setting chosen in the function declaration.\nLet’s use our new function to look a plot of an example country. For example lets look at the country of India from years 1980-2020, during the month of January. For this example, we will use a min_obs of 10 years and use the default settings for the plotly graph.\n\n# Example variables\n(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs) = (\"India\", 1980, 2020, 1, 10)\n\n# Call function\ntemperature_coefficient_plot(\"database.db\", country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs)\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see an interactive graph was produced by our function. We can zoom in and out on the graph and we are also able to hover over the datapoints to see what the expected rate of change of temperature will be. We can also see that there is a scale on the right that shows how the color of the data point correlates to the rate of change."

The data we are using consists of three different tables: stations, countries, and temperatures. This data has been collected and shows the temperature readings of different stations in various countries over the years.\nWe will use this data to answer our first question: How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?\nThus we need to use an SQL query to acess the data that is useful for answering this question.\nWe will also need to include the headers necessary for the rest of the post.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport sqlite3\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nHere is the query we will use.

    "text": "Question 3: How does the temperature vary across different latitudes within a specific country for a given month?\nThis next question we try to answer is intruiging as we can see if there is a correlation between latitude and temperature for a country within a given month.\nWe first must define our new query function, query_temperature_by_latitude, which requires a user to input a county and a month to be visualized.\nThe query returns the name and latitude of the station as well as the average temperature for the selected station.\n\ndef query_temperature_by_latitude(db_file, country, month):\n    with sqlite3.connect(db_file) as conn:\n        cmd = f\"\"\"\n            SELECT\n                stations.NAME,\n                stations.LATITUDE,\n                AVG(temperatures.Temp) AS AvgTemperature\n            FROM\n                temperatures\n            JOIN\n                stations ON temperatures.ID = stations.ID\n            JOIN\n                countries ON SUBSTR(stations.ID, 1, 2) = SUBSTR(countries.\"FIPS 10-4\", 1, 2)\n            WHERE\n                countries.Name = '{country}'\n                AND temperatures.Month = {month}\n            GROUP BY\n                stations.NAME, stations.LATITUDE\n            ORDER BY\n                stations.LATITUDE\n        \"\"\"\n\n        result_df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)\n\n    return result_df\n\nLet’s take a look at what this resulting data frame will look like, using the United States and the month of March.\n\ndf = query_temperature_by_latitude(db_file, \"United States\", 3)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME\nLATITUDE\nAvgTemperature\n\n\n\n\n0\nNAALEHU_14\n19.0614\n21.607500\n\n\n1\nKIOLAKAA_7\n19.0667\n20.521212\n\n\n2\nSOUTH_KONA_2232\n19.0825\n18.292609\n\n\n3\nSEA_MTN_1215\n19.1336\n22.496250\n\n\n4\nPAHALA_21\n19.1986\n19.954773\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n12548\nALPINE\n70.3464\n-22.067143\n\n\n12549\nCOLVILLE_VILLAGE\n70.4322\n-25.835909\n\n\n12550\nWAINWRIGHT_AP\n70.6392\n-24.802381\n\n\n12551\nBARROW_POST_ROGERS_AP\n71.2833\n-25.335980\n\n\n12552\nBARROW_4_ENE\n71.3214\n-23.970000\n\n\n\n\n12553 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nNext, we define our function plot_temperature_by_latitude, that will give us the scatter plot of all the stations used.\nThe function again uses the plotly library to produce the graph.\n\ndef plot_temperature_by_latitude(db_file, country, month):\n    result_df = query_temperature_by_latitude(db_file, country, month)\n\n    if result_df.empty:\n        print(\"No data available for the specified parameters.\")\n        return\n\n    fig = px.scatter(\n        result_df,\n        x=\"LATITUDE\",\n        y=\"AvgTemperature\",\n        color=\"AvgTemperature\",\n        size_max=20, \n        title=f\"Temperature Variation by Latitude in {country}, Month {month}\",\n        labels={\"LATITUDE\": \"Latitude\", \"AvgTemperature\": \"Average Temperature\"},\n        hover_name=\"NAME\",\n    )\n\n    fig.show()\n\nNow that we have defined our plotting function, let’s plot the temperatures in the United States and see if we can find any interesting trends.\n\nplot_temperature_by_latitude(db_file, \"United States\", 3)\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the plot, there is a clear trend in the United States. As latitude inrcreaes, the average temperature decreases. This intuitively makes sense as we see that the stations in Hawaii are the warmest, while the stations in Alaska are the coldest. This placement is correct as we know that Hawaii is one of the hotest states and Alaska one of the coldest.\nThe graph is also interactive as the user is able to hover over each scatterpoint on the graph and check its latitude and average temperature. There is also a color coded scale on the right that shows the warmer stations as warm colors (yellow, orange) and the colder staions as cold colors (purple, blue)."
